mortality_veneto


The goal of mortality_veneto is to analyse the all-causes mortality in the Veneto region, Italy, during COVID-19 pandemic and to compare it with the all-causes mortality of the previous years.
Mortality raw data have been downloaded from https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/240401  on 2020-04-15, resident population data have been downloaded from http://dati.istat.it/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=DCIS_POPRES1 on 2020-04-15


On 2020-09-20, for the revision of the paper, we downloaded from the same
websites the updated data of both all-causes mortality and resident population.
In all the folders it is possible to find the old datasets and script
and the new ones (the new files are saved as "oldname_rev").

Both old and new raw data have been uploaded as *.rds instead of 
*.xlsx
